# swiftcodesparser

Simple scraper that scrapes swift codes from specified site in the config.
I cannot show specific site from that I scrape codes. 

This project was developed is only to show my level of knowledge of the go. And I'm appreciate if you share with me ideas, in which place I need to improve my code and knowledge.
