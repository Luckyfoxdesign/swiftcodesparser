# swiftcodesparser

Scrapes swift codes from specified site in the config.
I cannot show specific site from that I scrape codes. 

This project was developed is only to show my level of knowledge of the go. And I'm appreciate if you share with me ideas, in which place I need to improve my code and knowledge.

# Why I don't use ready libs or default html package?
It's more interesting to create program from the zero by yourself. 
I will face with many problems and will try to solve it. When I fix problems I learn many interesting
parts in the language and how these parts work. So I learn language much deeper.

In the future I wanna learn html package. I think for static sites is more simple to get html elements contents with it than too loop through an each html symbol. And much easier to rewrite if a website changes his classes. Will see. Who knows.

And when I feel myself much confident with the Go I'll try ready libraries. If with them I'll write code much faster it will be great.
